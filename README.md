# reverse penpal club (get less postal mail)

In addition to sender-specific ways to get less postal mail, there are some central/systematic things you can do:

 * [National Do Not Mail List](http://www.directmail.com/mail_preference/)
     * private analog of the government [Do Not Call Registry](https://donotcall.gov/)
 * [OptOutPrescreen](https://www.optoutprescreen.com/)
     * specifically for credit card offers etc.
 * [DMAchoice.org](https://dmachoice.thedma.org/)
     * Direct Marketing Association's preferences for catalogs, etc.

Here's one sender-specific thing:

 * [Bed Bath & Beyond direct mail unsubscribe](https://offers.bedbathandbeyond.com/SignupWidget/dynamic/BBBUS-DM_Unsub)
     * They still warn "This request may take over 90 days to be removed."
